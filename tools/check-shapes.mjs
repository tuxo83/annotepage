/* WHAT CAN BE CHECKED WITHOUT NAMING ANYBODY.

   THE LEAK GUARD CANNOT LIVE HERE, AND THAT IS NOT A GAP TO PLUG. Its patterns
   are names -- a person, a company, a client, a supplier -- and writing them
   into this repository to search for them would publish every one of them in
   the history, which is the one thing it exists to prevent. So it stays on the
   machine, outside, and CI has no way to run it.

   THIS IS THE OTHER HALF, AND IT IS THE HALF CI CAN HAVE. Some leaks have a
   SHAPE rather than a name: a home directory, an email address, a machine's
   address. None of those needs a secret list to be recognised, so they can be
   refused here -- on every push, on every pull request, and from a machine that
   has never heard of the guard.

   It does not replace the guard. A client's name is a word like any other and
   nothing here will ever see it. What this removes is the accident: a path
   pasted from a terminal, an address left in an example, an author line typed
   from muscle memory -- which is the mistake that actually happened.

   EVERY RULE IS AN ALLOWLIST OF SHAPES, never a denylist of names. */
